# Framer Motion and Web Dependencies Removal Summary

## Task Overview
Fix Metro bundler errors related to tslib ESM module resolution while maintaining cross-platform compatibility (web, iOS, Android).

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE - October 2025

The original approach of blocking framer-motion entirely has been **superseded** by a more sophisticated solution that:
- ✅ Allows framer-motion to work on web (via moti)
- ✅ Works correctly on native platforms
- ✅ Fixes the tslib ESM resolution error
- ✅ Maintains full cross-platform compatibility

**See:** [METRO_TSLIB_FIX.md](./METRO_TSLIB_FIX.md) for the complete solution.

## Current Solution (October 2025)

### Metro Configuration (metro.config.js)
**Action**: Custom resolver to force tslib to use CommonJS version
```javascript
config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (moduleName === 'tslib' || moduleName.startsWith('tslib/')) {
    const tslibPath = path.join(
      context.projectRoot || __dirname,
      'node_modules/tslib/tslib.js',
    );
    return {
      filePath: tslibPath,
      type: 'sourceFile',
    };
  }
  // ... default resolver
};
```
**Reason**: Prevents the "Cannot destructure property '__extends' of 'tslib.default'" error by ensuring Metro always resolves tslib to the CommonJS version instead of the problematic ESM module.

**Benefits**:
- Works on all platforms (web, iOS, Android)
- Allows moti to use framer-motion on web
- No code changes required in app components
- Future-proof with unstable_enablePackageExports

## Original Changes Implemented (Historical Reference)

### 1. Metro Configuration (metro.config.js) - SUPERSEDED
**Original Action**: Blocked framer-motion in resolver.blockList
```javascript
config.resolver.blockList = [/node_modules\/framer-motion\/.*/];
```
**Reason**: Originally attempted to prevent Metro bundler from resolving framer-motion.
**Status**: ❌ SUPERSEDED - This approach broke moti on web and was too restrictive.

**New Solution**: Use custom resolver to fix tslib instead of blocking framer-motion.

### 2. Babel Configuration (babel.config.js)
**Action**: Added react-native-reanimated/plugin as the last plugin
```javascript
plugins.push('react-native-reanimated/plugin');
```
**Reason**: React Native Reanimated requires its Babel plugin to be the last one in the plugins array for proper code transformation.

### 3. Direction Arrow Component (components/weather/direction-arrow.tsx)
**Action**: Replaced `Animated` from 'react-native' with `Animated` from 'react-native-reanimated'
```javascript
// Before
import { View, Animated } from 'react-native';

// After
import { View } from 'react-native';
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';
```
**Reason**: Using react-native-reanimated provides better performance and consistency with other animated components in the app.

## Verification Results

### ✅ No Framer Motion Direct Imports
- Searched all source files (excluding node_modules)
- **Result**: Zero direct imports of framer-motion found
- Framer-motion exists only as a peer dependency of moti (which is acceptable and isolated)

### ✅ All Charts Use Victory-Native
Verified all chart components use the React Native compatible library:
1. `components/forecast/precipitation-chart.tsx` ✓
2. `components/forecast/weather-chart.tsx` ✓
3. `components/forecast/current-card.tsx` ✓
4. `components/forecast/wave-card.tsx` ✓
5. `components/forecast/temperature-chart.tsx` ✓
6. `components/forecast/wind-card.tsx` ✓

All using: `import { CartesianChart, Line, Area, Bar } from 'victory-native';`

### ✅ All Animations Use React Native Compatible Libraries
**Moti Usage** (1 file):
- `components/ui/animated-card.tsx` - Uses MotiView for card animations

**React Native Reanimated Usage** (5 files):
1. `components/weather/direction-arrow.tsx` - Uses Animated.View
2. `components/ui/popover.tsx` - Uses FadeIn, FadeOut
3. `components/ui/native-only-animated-view.tsx` - Uses Animated.View
4. `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Uses animation utilities
5. `components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Uses FadeIn, FadeOut

**React Native Animated API** (2 files):
- `components/ui/sheet.tsx` - Uses basic Animated.View (acceptable for simple animations)
- `components/maps/bottom-sheet.tsx` - Uses basic Animated.View (acceptable for simple animations)

### ✅ No Web-Only @radix-ui Imports
- Searched all source files
- **Result**: Zero direct @radix-ui imports in source code
- @radix-ui packages are used internally by @rn-primitives (React Native compatible wrappers)

### ✅ All Modals/Dialogs Use React Native Primitives
Verified all modal/dialog implementations:
1. `components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Uses @rn-primitives/dialog ✓
2. `components/profile-modal.tsx` - Uses React Native Modal ✓
3. `components/ui/popover.tsx` - Uses @rn-primitives/popover ✓
4. `components/maps/report-form-dialog.tsx` - Uses @rn-primitives/dialog ✓

### ✅ Linting and Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint
```
**Result**: All checks passed ✓
- ESLint: No errors
- Prettier: All files formatted correctly

## Package Dependencies Status

### Correct React Native Compatible Libraries
- ✅ `moti@0.30.0` - React Native animations (depends on framer-motion but isolated)
- ✅ `react-native-reanimated@~4.1.1` - React Native animations
- ✅ `victory-native@^41.20.1` - React Native charts
- ✅ `@rn-primitives/*` - React Native UI primitives (wraps @radix-ui for RN)
- ✅ `react-native-svg@15.12.1` - React Native SVG support

### Peer Dependencies (Working Correctly)
- ✅ `framer-motion@6.5.1` - Dependency of moti (now working correctly on web via custom tslib resolver)

## Testing Recommendations

Run the following command to test the bundle:
```bash
npx expo start -c
```

**Note**: In CI environments, the bundler may take longer to start. For production testing, use:
```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

## Architecture Notes

### Animation Strategy
The app uses a layered animation approach:
1. **Moti** - For declarative animations with simple API (uses framer-motion on web, native animations on iOS/Android)
2. **React Native Reanimated** - For complex animations requiring fine control
3. **React Native Animated API** - For simple, basic animations (e.g., bottom sheets)

This approach is optimal because:
- Moti provides a clean API similar to framer-motion but for React Native
- Custom Metro resolver ensures tslib works correctly across all platforms
- React Native Reanimated plugin ensures proper transformation
- All animations work on native platforms without web dependencies
- Web platform can use framer-motion when needed (via moti)

### Portal/Modal Strategy
The app uses @rn-primitives which provides:
- React Native compatible implementations
- Consistent API across platforms
- Native platform optimizations
- Proper accessibility support

## Conclusion

✅ **All tasks completed successfully**

The codebase now has:
- ✅ Fixed Metro bundler tslib ESM resolution error
- ✅ Zero direct web-only dependencies
- ✅ Proper Metro configuration with custom tslib resolver
- ✅ Correct Babel plugin ordering for react-native-reanimated
