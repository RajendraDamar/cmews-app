# BMKG Weather Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created an engaging BMKG Weather Dashboard for the Home tab using React Native Reusables components. The implementation follows shadcn/ui design patterns and provides a modern, responsive weather display.

## Components Created

### 1. **components/weather/weather-icon.tsx**
- Maps BMKG weather conditions to Lucide icons with colored backgrounds
- Supported conditions:
  - Cerah → Sun (yellow-500, bg: yellow-100)
  - Cerah Berawan → CloudSun (orange-400, bg: orange-100)
  - Berawan → Cloud (gray-400, bg: gray-100)
  - Hujan Ringan → CloudDrizzle (blue-400, bg: blue-100)
  - Hujan Sedang → CloudRain (blue-500, bg: blue-100)
  - Hujan Lebat → CloudRainWind (blue-700, bg: blue-200)
  - Hujan Petir/Petir → CloudLightning (purple-500, bg: purple-100)
  - Kabut → CloudFog (gray-300, bg: gray-100)
- Returns View with rounded-full background and scaled icon
- Props: `{ condition: string, size?: number }`

### 2. **components/weather/hero-card.tsx**
- Large Card component with gradient background
- Features:
  - Temperature in 48px (mobile) / 60px (desktop) bold text
  - Animated weather icon (80px)
  - Location hierarchy display (kecamatan, kota, provinsi)
  - Last updated timestamp
  - Gradient background: blue-500 (light mode) / blue-900 (dark mode)
- Props: `{ temperature, weather, location, lastUpdate }`

### 3. **components/weather/quick-stats.tsx**
- Horizontal ScrollView with Card components
- Displays:
  - Humidity with progress bar indicator
  - Wind speed
  - Feels-like temperature
- Uses Lucide icons: Droplets, Wind, Thermometer
- Includes Progress component (visual bar) for humidity
- Min width 140px per card
- Props: `{ humidity, windSpeed, feelsLike }`

### 4. **components/weather/hourly-forecast-card.tsx**
- Card with CardHeader and CardContent
- Horizontal ScrollView for 24h forecast (3-hour intervals)
- Displays: time (HH:mm), weather icon, temperature
- Uses WeatherIcon component for colored icons
- Props: `{ hourlyData: { time, weather, temp }[] }`

### 5. **components/weather/detailed-metrics.tsx**
- Custom accordion implementation (since Accordion component doesn't exist)
- Three expandable sections:
  - **Temperature**: Current, Feels Like, Min, Max
  - **Wind**: Speed, Direction, Gust
  - **Atmospheric**: Pressure, Humidity, Visibility
- Each item shows detailed data with icons and Separator
- Uses Thermometer, Wind, Gauge icons with ChevronDown/Up
- Props: `{ temperature, wind, atmospheric }`

## Files Updated

### 1. **app/(tabs)/index.tsx** (Complete Rewrite)
- Removed all existing content
- Created engaging weather dashboard layout
- Uses BMKG API data structure
- Implements pull-to-refresh with RefreshControl
- Responsive layouts:
  - Mobile (< 768px): Stack all components vertically, full width
  - Desktop (>= 1024px): 2-column grid (40% hero, 60% quick stats)
- Uses useBreakpoint() hook for responsive logic
- Loading states with Skeleton components
- Dark mode support with theme-aware gradients

### 2. **lib/data/weather-mock.ts**
- Added mockWeatherData export with BMKG structure
- Includes hourly array (8 entries for 3-hour intervals)
- Includes daily array (7 days forecast)
- All weather conditions in Indonesian
- Already had 5 different provinces (Jakarta, Jawa Barat, Jawa Timur, Bali, Sulawesi Selatan)

### 3. **lib/types/weather.ts**
- No changes needed - types already match requirements
- Existing interfaces: BMKGWeatherData, BMKGLocation, BMKGWeatherCondition, BMKGHourlyData, BMKGDailyData

## Key Features Implemented

### Responsive Design
✅ Mobile: Stack all components vertically, full width
✅ Desktop: 2-column grid (40% hero card, 60% quick stats)
✅ Uses useBreakpoint() hook from lib/breakpoints.ts

### Pull-to-Refresh
✅ RefreshControl component implemented
✅ Theme-aware refresh indicator colors
✅ Smooth refresh animation

### Loading States
✅ Skeleton loaders for hero card, quick stats, hourly forecast
✅ 1.5s simulated loading on initial mount
✅ Smooth transitions when data loads

### Dark Mode
✅ Theme-aware classes using cn() utility
✅ Gradient backgrounds adjust for dark mode (blue-500 → blue-900)
✅ Icon colors remain consistent with colorScheme
✅ All components support dark mode

### Design System
✅ NativeWind (Tailwind) classes throughout
✅ No inline styles except for dynamic colors
✅ Follows shadcn/ui design patterns
✅ Consistent spacing (p-4, gap-4, mb-4)

## Notes & Adaptations

1. **Accordion Component**: Since the repo doesn't have an Accordion component from React Native Reusables, I created a custom accordion implementation using Pressable and state management with smooth animations.

2. **Select Component**: The requirement mentioned a Select component for location hierarchy, but the existing LocationSelector already handles this functionality, so it was reused.

3. **Progress Component**: Implemented a simple progress bar using View with dynamic width instead of a separate Progress component (which doesn't exist in the repo).

4. **Minimal Changes**: Kept the existing DailyForecast component as-is since it already works well with the dashboard.

## Testing
✅ All files pass ESLint validation
✅ All files pass Prettier formatting
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors in new files
✅ Imports and dependencies verified
