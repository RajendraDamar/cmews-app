# Worklets Error Fix - October 11, 2025

## Problem

```
[Worklets] createSerializableObject should never be called in JSWorklets.
```

App crashed on startup with this error.

## Root Cause

**Duplicate worklets runtime conflict** caused by:
- `react-native-worklets` listed as direct dependency in package.json
- `react-native-reanimated` already includes worklets functionality
- Two worklets runtimes conflicting with each other

## Solution

### 1. Remove Direct Worklets Dependency

```bash
npm uninstall react-native-worklets
```

### 2. Clean Install

```bash
rm -rf node_modules .expo
npm install
```

### 3. Start Fresh

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

## Why This Works

- `react-native-reanimated` (v4.1.1) already includes `react-native-worklets` as a **peer dependency**
- Having it as a direct dependency creates duplicate runtime
- Metro bundler loads both, causing serialization conflicts
- Removing direct dependency lets Reanimated manage worklets

## Verification

âœ… No `react-native-worklets` in package.json dependencies  
âœ… Reanimated plugin is last in babel.config.js  
âœ… App starts without worklets errors  

## Tech Stack (Confirmed Working)

```json
{
  "react-native-reanimated": "~4.1.1",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "~2.28.0",
  "moti": "^0.30.0",
  "victory-native": "^41.20.1",
  "@shopify/react-native-skia": "2.2.12"
}
```

## Key Points

1. **Never add `react-native-worklets` as direct dependency**
2. Always let `react-native-reanimated` manage it
3. Keep `react-native-reanimated/plugin` as **last** babel plugin
4. Clear cache after removing dependencies

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - App now starts successfully
