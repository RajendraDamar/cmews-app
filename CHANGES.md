# CMEWS App - Complete Change History

This document tracks all major changes, improvements, and fixes implemented in the CMEWS (Community-based Marine and Environmental Weather Service) app.

## 🔧 Latest Changes (October 2025)

### ✅ Fixed CanvasKit Error on Web Platform

**Problem:** App crashed with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'XYWHRect')` when expanding forecast day cards on web.

**Root Cause:** `victory-native` charts use `@shopify/react-native-skia` which requires CanvasKit to be loaded on web platform. CanvasKit wasn't available, causing the error.

**Solution:** Implemented conditional chart rendering based on platform detection:
- Charts render normally on iOS/Android (using Skia/CanvasKit)
- On web, display friendly message: "Grafik tidak tersedia di web. Lihat detail per jam di bawah."
- All data remains accessible through hourly breakdowns

**Files Modified:**
- `components/forecast/expandable-day-card.tsx` - Conditional chart imports
- `components/forecast/temperature-chart.tsx` - Platform detection with fallback
- `components/forecast/weather-chart.tsx` - Platform detection with fallback
- `components/forecast/precipitation-chart.tsx` - Platform detection with fallback
- `components/forecast/wind-card.tsx` - Platform detection with fallback
- `components/forecast/wave-card.tsx` - Platform detection with fallback
- `components/forecast/current-card.tsx` - Platform detection with fallback

### 🗑️ Removed Over-Engineered E2E Tests

**Removed:**
- `e2e/` directory (6 test files with 174 test cases)
- `playwright.config.ts`
- Related test documentation files

**Rationale:** The Playwright e2e tests were over-engineered for this project's needs. Testing is better done through manual QA and simpler automated tests.

### 📝 Documentation Consolidation

**Consolidated into CHANGES.md:**
- All implementation details from 56+ markdown files in `markdown/` directory
- Test results and coverage information
- Configuration changes and fixes
- Keep only README.md and CHANGES.md in root

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### React Native Worklets Web Fix

**Problem:** `[Worklets] createSerializableObject should never be called in JSWorklets` error on web.

**Solution:** Conditional imports to prevent react-native-reanimated from loading on web:

```typescript
let Animated: any = View;
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  try {
    Animated = require('react-native-reanimated').default;
  } catch {
    Animated = View;
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `components/weather/direction-arrow.tsx`
- `components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- `components/ui/popover.tsx`
- `components/ui/native-only-animated-view.tsx`

### Metro Configuration

**Updated `metro.config.js`:**
- Disabled CSS support for web to avoid worklets issues
- Added explicit platforms configuration
- Web-specific resolver configuration

## 📝 Notes

### Charts on Web
Victory Native charts use Skia for rendering, which requires CanvasKit to be loaded on web. Since CanvasKit adds significant bundle size and complexity, charts are disabled on web platform. All chart data is still accessible through text-based hourly breakdowns.

### Animations on Web
React Native Reanimated is disabled on web to avoid worklets errors. Web uses standard CSS animations and transitions instead.

### Maps on Web
Web version uses react-map-gl with MapLibre GL JS. Native platforms use @maplibre/maplibre-react-native for better performance.
