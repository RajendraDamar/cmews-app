# Worklets Web Error Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
```
[Worklets] createSerializableObject should never be called in JSWorklets
```
Error occurred when running the app on **web platform**.

## Root Causes

1. **`react-native-reanimated` on web** tries to initialize worklets runtime
2. **Skeleton component** was using Reanimated's `useSharedValue` and `useAnimatedStyle`
3. **Web platform** doesn't support worklets the same way native does

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Skeleton Component (Web-Compatible Animation)

**File**: `components/ui/skeleton.tsx`

**Before** (Reanimated - causes web errors):
```tsx
import Animated, {
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useSharedValue,
  withRepeat,
  withTiming,
  withSequence,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

**After** (React Native's Animated API - web-compatible):
```tsx
import { Animated, Platform } from 'react-native';

const opacity = React.useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;

Animated.loop(
  Animated.sequence([
    Animated.timing(opacity, {
      toValue: 0.5,
      duration: 1000,
      useNativeDriver: Platform.OS !== 'web',
    }),
    Animated.timing(opacity, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 1000,
      useNativeDriver: Platform.OS !== 'web',
    }),
  ])
).start();
```

### 2. Updated Babel Config

**File**: `babel.config.js`

**Change**: Only load Reanimated plugin for native platforms

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  
  return {
    presets: [['babel-preset-expo', { jsxImportSource: 'nativewind' }], 'nativewind/babel'],
    plugins: [
      // Reanimated plugin MUST be last and only for native
      ...(process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_PLATFORM !== 'web' ? ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'] : []),
    ],
  };
};
```

### 3. Removed Direct Worklets Dependency

**File**: `package.json`

‚úÖ **Removed**: `"react-native-worklets": "0.5.1"`  
‚úÖ **Kept**: Reanimated manages worklets as peer dependency

## Why This Works

### Skeleton Fix
- React Native's built-in `Animated` API works on **all platforms** (iOS, Android, Web)
- Reanimated's worklets-based animations only work properly on **native platforms**
- Setting `useNativeDriver: false` on web prevents native module errors

### Babel Fix  
- Reanimated's Babel plugin transforms worklet code during build
- Web doesn't need this transformation (no worklets runtime)
- Conditionally excluding the plugin on web prevents initialization issues

### No Direct Worklets
- `react-native-reanimated` v4.1.1 includes worklets as peer dependency
- Having it as direct dependency creates conflicts
- Let Reanimated manage its own worklets version

## Testing

### Web
```bash
npm run web --clear
```
‚úÖ No worklets errors  
‚úÖ Skeleton animation works smoothly  
‚úÖ App loads successfully  

### Native (iOS/Android)
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```
‚úÖ Full Reanimated support  
‚úÖ Worklets enabled  
‚úÖ Native animations work  

## Key Learnings

1. **Use Platform.OS checks** when choosing animation APIs
2. **React Native Animated** = Web-safe, basic animations
3. **Reanimated** = Native-only, advanced animations  
4. **Never add react-native-worklets** as direct dependency
5. **Conditional Babel plugins** based on platform

## Files Changed

1. ‚úèÔ∏è `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Switched to RN Animated API
2. ‚úèÔ∏è `babel.config.js` - Conditional Reanimated plugin
3. üóëÔ∏è Removed `react-native-worklets` from `package.json`

## Status

üü¢ **FIXED** - App now works on both web and native platforms without worklets errors!
