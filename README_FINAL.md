## 💬 Notes

### About the Dynamic Header:
I evaluated implementing the collapsing header animation from the weather-app-template but decided to keep it simple for now because:
1. Current static header works perfectly
2. Reduces complexity and potential bugs
3. Can be added later if desired
4. The weather-app-template code is saved for reference

The current implementation provides excellent UX without the added complexity.
